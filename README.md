> The brain is like a muscle. When it is in use we feel very good. Understanding is joyous.

## Learning Objectives - The student should be able to...

* Needs to be filled out

## What the student can do at this point 

* * Create variables and constants
* Is familiar with type annotations, type inference and string interpolation.
* Can create functions with return types.
* Is familiar with the String, Int, Double, and Bool type.
* Can perform arithmetic operations on Int and Double.
* Understands if and else clause statements.
* Can create and use Arrays.
* Can iterate over an Array using a for-in loop.
* Can iterate over an Array calling enumerate().
* Work with the following methods on arrays:
	* append()
	* insert(_:atIndex:)
	* removeAtIndex()
	* subscript syntax with arrays
	* count
	* isEmpty
	* Optionals
* Can work with dictoinaries 
* Can iterate over a dictionary
* Knows about optionals (should at this point)
## Outline / Notes

*  I think this should be anywhere between 10-15 questions.
* Should start simple, asking the student to create various kind of dictionaries.
* Maybe include incorrect code where they have to recognize the bug and fix it.
* I like the idea of one question being something like... "Given a dictionary where the keys are numbers representing the grades of a highschool (ranging from 9 - 12). The values represent the grades received on an exam the entire school had to take. Which grade received had the highest average on the exam?"  ... This problem might be too hard?? Or... I'm not entirely against the last 2-3 questions being very difficult where it challenges them.
* I've included the playground file.
